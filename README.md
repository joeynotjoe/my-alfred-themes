## Tahoe 26 - Alfred Themes

My attempt at replicating the modern Spotlight interface from macOS 26 "Tahoe". There's only so much I can do until Alfred is updated to support more of the visual glass style guidelines, but it's not too bad for now!

### Installation

1. Download the theme file
2. Double-click to install in Alfred


### Suggested Alfred Settings

1. Open Alfred Preferences » Appearance
2. Click on "Options", at the bottom of the left-pane containing your installed themes.
3. To best match Spotlight, use the following settings:

- ✅️ Hide hat on Alfred window
- ✅️ Hide result shortcuts
- Show result subtext: **Always**
- I want to see: **7** visible result items
